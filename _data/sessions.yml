  title: "Scaling clusters declaratively with Kubernetes and Docker"
  description: "<p>We’ve all written an application from scratch before. You start with some code on your laptop and tell a server to run it. You make tweaks, update manually, and realize that you’ve committed yourself to a very imperative process. It’s manual. Inefficient. What’s worse, it’s completely unreproducible.</p><p>So then you might turn to Docker, which solves the process-level reproducibility by packaging up a full execution environment. But once we get beyond a single machine, we need to coordinate the work across a cluster of machines -- trying to do it imperatively can quickly turn into a tangled mess! You want to declare to your cluster what you expect it to do, and have the cluster assign the resources to get it done, recover from failures, and scale easily.</p><p>Kubernetes is a recently open sourced cluster manager and scheduler that simplifies the complex tasks of deploying and managing your application. You simply declare the desired state, and Kubernetes does the work to keep it that way. In this talk, we’ll do a hands-on demonstration of how you can move from a single Docker container to many containers running across a cluster of machines by using Kubernetes.</p>"

  description: "<p>With a pre authenticated cloud-based ecosystem Google Apps Script makes it possible to integrate into other Google services with a couple of lines of code. This turns Google Drive into a rich playground for custom reporting using Google Sheets as a data interface. In this session there will be a quick Google Apps Script 101 highlighting some of it’s main features and affordances. This will be followed by a demonstration of how Google Apps Script makes it easy to combine Google Analytics with other data sources such as Twitter and do many more playful things.</p>"

  description: "<p>This session is covers some advanced uses of Google Analytics through the Google Apps Script service which is part of Google Drive. As part of this both data connection and collection using Google Apps Script will be explored. The session will demonstrates how Apps Script can be used to generate simple web services for the display of custom reporting in other websites including Google Sites. As part of this we take a look at how the Google Analytics Measurement Protocol and how it can be interfaced with Apps Script to provide insight into anything that can send POST including your script projects, Drive services like Sheets, Forms and Docs or even a baby monitor.</p>"
