  title: "Scaling clusters declaratively with Kubernetes and Docker"
  description: "<p>We’ve all written an application from scratch before. You start with some code on your laptop and tell a server to run it. You make tweaks, update manually, and realize that you’ve committed yourself to a very imperative process. It’s manual. Inefficient. What’s worse, it’s completely unreproducible.</p><p>So then you might turn to Docker, which solves the process-level reproducibility by packaging up a full execution environment. But once we get beyond a single machine, we need to coordinate the work across a cluster of machines -- trying to do it imperatively can quickly turn into a tangled mess! You want to declare to your cluster what you expect it to do, and have the cluster assign the resources to get it done, recover from failures, and scale easily.</p><p>Kubernetes is a recently open sourced cluster manager and scheduler that simplifies the complex tasks of deploying and managing your application. You simply declare the desired state, and Kubernetes does the work to keep it that way. In this talk, we’ll do a hands-on demonstration of how you can move from a single Docker container to many containers running across a cluster of machines by using Kubernetes.</p>"

  description: "<p>Scala isn't used or supported by Google to any great extent - but it doesn't need to be. Scala is a language that sits upon the JVM, and anywhere you can use Java, you can employ Scala instead. This talk will cover why you might want to, and introduce you to Scala - a modular functional language that scales well from prototyping to fully-fledged production systems. At the Guardian we found that Scala enabled us to deliver things faster with less code - and have more fun while we doing it.</p>"

  description: "<p>The Django is a great Python web framework, used by the likes of Instagram, Mozilla, Disqus and NASA, and it has been available on Google's highly scalable App Engine since 2008.  Until now Django on App Engine has been slightly limited by the database options and lack of support for recent versions.  This has all changed.</p><p>With the new Djangae (jan-gee) library, you can now run the latest version of vanilla Django on App Engine, with the Django ORM connecting to the App Engine's non-relational Datastore, or to Google's Cloud-hosted MySQL, or both.  (The previously-used Django-nonrel fork is no longer needed.)</p><p>With over 4 years of App Engine experience and 5 years of Django expertise, Adam Alton shows you how these 2 technologies are now in seamless harmony, allowing your Django applications to scale to the next level.</p>"

  description: "<p>This hands on workshop gives you the opportunity to bring an existing Django application and port it to run on Google App Engine, under the expert guidance of Adam Alton from Potato London.</p><p>Adam will provide a step-by-step approach to setting up your application, as well as giving hands on assistance with getting your project up and running.</p><p>You should bring a laptop with the App Engine SDK installed, and a simple Django project which you would like to run on Google App Engine.  The simpler the Django project the better; there is a huge amount to learn in getting a project set up on App Engine, so the simpler your application is the better your chance of completing the port within the workshop time.  In particular, applications which have long-running processes, do a lot of JOIN queries (especially M2M relationships), or use the filesystem for storage will require considerably more refactoring and are best avoided if possible.</p><p>Please set up a new App Engine application at <a href=\"https://appengine.google.com/\">https://appengine.google.com/</a> prior to the workshop.</p><p>Recommended reading:</p><ul><li>Eventual consistency: <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/developers/articles/balancing-strong-and-eventual-consistency-with-google-cloud-datastore/\">https://cloud.google.com/developers/articles/balancing-strong-and-eventual-consistency-with-google-cloud-datastore/</a></li><li>App Engine documentation (although note that we will not be using the <code>webapp2</code> framework): <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/\">https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/</a></li></ul>"
